# VR_TowerDefense_And_Chill

This project was build during Lauzhack 2017 by a team of 4 friends. The challenge was to bring together HTC Vive and new Logitech G Bridge SDK. We came up with a Tower defense game that use both VR and new Logitech SDK.

The user is immersed in a simple tower defense game. The objective is to defend the castle against the attack of aggressive, yet oddly charming, zombie bunnies. The player can visualize the sceen through his VR headset and intereact with it using virtual keybord. He can can places traps and activate them as ennemies pass over it to attack his castle.

Last as long as you can against those filthy zombies !
