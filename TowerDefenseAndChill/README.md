## Unity Plugin sample

We provide a sample Unity project with some scripts which are required to integrate the DLL (they are located in  “Assets/BridgeSDK”). The libraries in the “Plugins” directory are also required. There is a sample script (in the Scripts directory) which will show you how to use the wrapper.

> IMPORTANT: This client application needs to connect to the Bridge software. Therefore you **must have Bridge running** prior to executing the samples

You can load and run the scene we provided to see a help message displayed in front of the main camera.
Note:  the shortcuts will output their respective results in the console.

The scene runs the Bridge SDK in a singleton object that handles connecting to and disconnecting from the Bridge runtime during Unity’s Awake(), respectively OnApplicationQuit() functions. Make sure the Bridge runtime is running prior to launching the Unity scene. If the connection fails, a message will appear in the console.

The example uses the “BridgeManager” object to attach the BridgeSDK to. From there, any game object with a script component can access functions, as shown in the script attached to the “SampleController” object.

Information about performances: Since the Bridge developer DLL and the Unity plugin are performing I/O operations, it is therefore recommended that you call the API functions within a separate thread, else it might impact your game's performances. At this stage of development, multithreading and concurrent access have not been tested yet.


## Notes
* Warning: At this stage of development, the C# to C++ wrapper requires the C# compiler to run in ‘unsafe’ mode by having the mcs.rsp (or smcs.rsp) file in the Assets folder.

* The Logitech Bridge libraries and their dependencies must be part of the project, so make sure that you copied all the DLLs which are located in the "Assets\Plugins\x64" folder.

* The sample project does not include any third party VR plugin or software (SteamVR not included).

* Please contact supportsdk@logitech.com or reach us via GitHub if you have any question.
